# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge

## Overview
In this exercise, I determine key metrics about home sales data. I use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached. 

## Resources Used
I used course-provided starter code, assistance from AskBCS Learning Assistants, Tutors, Chat GPT, and Stack Overflow.
